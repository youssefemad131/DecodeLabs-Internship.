## 📋 Projects Overview

### 🤖 Project 1 — Rule-Based AI Chatbot
> **Phase:** Foundation | **Type:** Deterministic AI | **Concept:** White Box System

Build a rule-based chatbot (DecoBot) from scratch using pure Python — no ML, no neural networks. Master control flow, decision-making logic, and the IPO model before touching any machine learning.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Key Concepts** | Control flow, if-else logic, dictionary O(1) lookup, infinite loop, input sanitization |
| **Tech Stack** | Python, `random`, `datetime` |
| **Architecture** | IPO Model — Input (Sanitization) → Process (Intent Matching) → Output (Response) |
| **Highlight** | Dictionary-based lookup is ~100x faster than if-elif ladders at scale |

---

### 🌸 Project 2 — Data Classification Using AI
> **Phase:** Predictive | **Type:** Supervised Learning | **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors

Build a complete KNN classifier on the Iris dataset — covering the full ML pipeline from raw data exploration to validated model predictions.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Key Concepts** | Feature scaling, train-test split, KNN, confusion matrix, F1 score, elbow method |
| **Tech Stack** | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Dataset** | Iris — 150 samples, 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), 4 features |
| **Highlight** | Elbow Method to find optimal K + decision boundary visualization |

---

### 🎯 Project 3 — AI Recommendation Logic
> **Phase:** Intelligent Systems | **Type:** Content-Based Filtering | **Algorithm:** TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity

Build an AI-powered job recommendation engine using 956 real Glassdoor job postings. The system maps user skills to job roles using TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity — no neural networks, pure algorithmic logic.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Key Concepts** | Content-based filtering, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, vector space model, cold start |
| **Tech Stack** | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Regex |
| **Dataset** | Glassdoor Jobs (Kaggle) — 956 postings, 328 unique titles, 63 industries |
| **Highlight** | TF-IDF matrix of 848 × 625 terms; rare skills (pytorch, kubernetes) scored higher than generic ones |
